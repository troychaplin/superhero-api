## Overall Look and Feel

While the rating criteria states that I am to be loyal to the requested layout, I also considered the "add creative features" item under the triple bonus points heading as the door being left open to present an improved design.

As a designer I felt that the look and feel could be significantly improved so I decided to break this rule and show some design skills by providing a simple card design in Figma. This also allowed me to further expand on the CSS required to show the my depth of knowledge and understanding of a responsive mobile first layout.

## Achieving Bonus Points

The following are things that I tried to incorporate into the project in order to earn single, double and triple bonus points. I understand that some of these can also see even more improvements and I look forward to feedback on how I can be better.

- Git flow and feature branches used throughout the project
- Added ESLint and Prettier to enforce consistent formatting
- SASS modules to scope style to each component and avoid style conflicts
- SASS variables and mixins to reduce style duplication
- Fully responsive layout with 4 breakpoints
- Unique look and feel including a heading font that could easily be found in any comic book
- Component composition to improve resuability
- Simple yet fun custom component for data loading and errors
- Added color elements to indicate if a hero is good, bad or neutral
- Validated with W3C Markup Validation Service
- A11y tested with Tenon.io
- Added changelog for release notes

## Easter Egg

As a means to play with `useEffect` and learn it first hand I've added an easter egg to the project. **Hint:** it's a popular mexican food whose fast food chain is represented by a chihuahua.
